abstract="Tensegrity structures are a new trend in the soft robotics field, especially for aerospace applications. However, many other applications, such as biomechanics, have not made full use of the advantages that this kind of structure presents yet. In this paper, we present a robotic joint based on a two-stage tensegrity structure. Using a marching procedure to find new stable positions, the control method calculates the required steps and actuates some of the cables until this new position is achieved. Preliminary experiments show that the structure can attain bending of 20{\textdegree} and maintain the equilibrium. This prototype shows that tensegrity structures can be effectively used for positioning in three dimensions.",
