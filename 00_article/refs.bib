The proposed mechanism simulates the wide motion ranges of the human shoulder joint and is composed of 3 rigid bodies and 16 steel wires with 3 mutually perpendicular rotating axes. Since it belongs to the class 1 tensegrity structure that the rigid bodies do not make any contact with each other, the joint has a certain amount of flexibility, which not only can help protect its mechanism from external impacts but also can prevent human injury that might happen when the mechanism and humans interact each other. Moreover, the proposed mechanism can be manufactured using fewer materials than a fully rigid mechanism, and thus, it can be made in a lightweight fashion and reduce the inertial effects as well. Finally, to actuate the robotic shoulder, the cables connected to each motor are able to drive the rotating shafts of the joint mechanism.}",

abstract = {The elbow is conventionally described as a uniaxial hinge joint and the pivot of proximal forearm rotation; the joint surfaces guide motion, the ligaments maintain joint integrity and the muscles cause motion. However, this simplicity is less clear on detailed examination and masks uncertainties over its component structures and their functions. Elbow anatomy is examined from a tensegrity perspective with a re-assessment of these functions. Tensegrity structures, like the elbow, are inherently stable and maintain a balanced equilibrium during changes in shape because of ‘continuous tension’. Connective tissues mechanically integrate local and distantly related components into a single functional unit while proprioceptive sensors neurally influence motor activity; both control joint dynamics. It is suggested that this has relevance to understanding the commonly encountered but vague pathologies such as ‘tennis elbow’ and ‘repetitive strain injury’; the aetiologies of these conditions continue to be the subject of debate.}

    abstract = "{We propose a method to design a tensegrity joint, making its elastic deformation an accurate joint-like motion, such as a rotation around the designed rotational center. The tensegrity joint can be a revolute, universal, and ball joint through this method. Axis drift is presented as a design criterion to describe the rotational center’s deviation degree with respect to the compliance center since the rotational center is not fixed to one point for different positions of the tensegrity joint. The axis drift is designed to be in a prescribed range so that the tensegrity joint is approximately equivalent to a rigid joint. In other words, the tensegrity joint’s elastic response under external torque and force becomes precise rigid joint-like kinematics and can replace rigid joints to transfer motion, force, and energy. A large-size tensegrity rotational joint is developed to verify the joint equivalence experimentally. The experimental results show that the tensegrity joint achieved maximum dimensionless axis drift of less than 2\\%, which indicates an excellent joint equivalence. The tensegrity joints’ ability to replace rigid joints as modular joints to construct a hyper redundant serial structure is demonstrated using a tensegrity robotic arm. The proposed compliant tensegrity joint has notable benefits of tensegrity structure, such as high mechanical efficiency, modularity, and scalability. It can be extended to many robotic applications, such as large-size serial robotic arms and snake-like robots.}",

journal = {Bioinspiration \& Biomimetics},
abstract = {In complex and unpredictable environments or in situations of human–robot interaction, a soft and flexible robot performs more safely and is more impact resistant compared to a traditional rigid robot. To enable robots to have bionic features (flexibility, compliance and variable stiffness) similar to human joints, structures involving suspended tubercle tensegrity are researched. The suspended tubercle gives the joint compliance and flexibility by isolating two moving parts. The variable stiffness capacity is achieved by changing the internal stress of tensegrity through the simultaneous contraction or relaxation of the driving tendons. A wrist-inspired tensegrity-based bionic joint is proposed as a case study. It has variable stiffness and two rotations with a total of three degrees of freedom. Through theoretical derivation and simulation calculation in the NASA Tensegrity RobotToolkit (NTRT) simulator, the range of motion, stiffness adjustable capacity, and their interaction are studied. A prototype is built and tested under a motion capture system. The experimental result agrees well with the theoretical simulation. Our experiments show that the suspended tubercle-type tensegrity is flexible, the stiffness is adjustable and easy to control, and it has great potential for bionic joints.}

abstract = {This paper proposes design strategies and a comparative study of two antagonistically actuated tensegrity joints: a revolute (R) joint and an anti-parallelogram (X) joint. Geometrically, the R-joint has a fixed center of rotation while the X-joint has a moving center of rotation. Both joints are equipped with two lateral springs and are actuated by cables passing through these springs. Such tensegrity joints can be of interest for developing lightweight manipulators. They are designed to reach a prescribed wrench-feasible workspace (WFW) with a minimum desired stiffness throughout. The design strategy relies on the determination of the complete feasible design space for the problem, rather than resorting to a numerical optimizer for a particular solution. This approach provides more insight into the problem and also presents the designer with all the feasible designs. Several case studies are considered with different WFW specifications and design objectives for the R- and X- joints. The optimal designs obtained for the two joints are compared in terms of their actuation forces, stiffness, geometry, and mass.}

However, many other applications, such as biomechanics, have not made full use of the advantages that this kind of structure presents yet. In this paper, we present a robotic joint based on a two-stage tensegrity structure. Using a marching procedure to find new stable positions, the control method calculates the required steps and actuates some of the cables until this new position is achieved. Preliminary experiments show that the structure can attain bending of 20{\textdegree} and maintain the equilibrium. This prototype shows that tensegrity structures can be effectively used for positioning in three dimensions.",

This paper proposes a new foot structure based on the mast-type octahedral tensegrity structure with the flexibility, self-stability and self-adaptability. First, the mast-type octahedral tensegrity structure is evolved, and the feasibility of the motion is verified by dynamic analysis, and the degrees of freedom of the structure are limited by adding cross-axis. Next, by adding a locking structure based on a ratchet structure, and it avoided the structural instability caused by excessive deformation of the tensegrity foot structure. Finally, the design of the new foot structure was completed and a physical prototype was fabricated to verify the function of the new foot structure through relevant experiments. The high symmetry of the mast-type octahedral tensegrity structure simplifies the stiffness matching of the elastic members of the tension foot mechanism. The locking structure based on the ratchet structure is used to realize the switching of the flexible adaptation function and the rigid support function of the tensegrity foot structure, thus avoiding the structural instability caused by excessive deformation of the tensegrity foot structure.}

abstract = {Although robots tend to be as competitive as CNC machines for some operations, they are not yet widely used for machining operations. This may be due to the lack of certain technical information that is required for satisfactory machining operation. For instance, it is very difficult to get information about the stiffness of industrial robots from robot manufacturers. As a consequence, this paper introduces a robust and fast procedure that can be used to identify the joint stiffness values of any six-revolute serial robot. This procedure aims to evaluate joint stiffness values considering both translational and rotational displacements of the robot end-effector for a given applied wrench (force and torque). In this paper, the links of the robot are assumed to be much stiffer than its actuated joints. The robustness of the identification method and the sensitivity of the results to measurement errors and the number of experimental tests are also analyzed. Finally, the actual Cartesian stiffness matrix of the robot is obtained from the joint stiffness values and can be used for motion planning and to optimize machining operations.}
